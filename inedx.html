                                        I have back, joint and leg problems. This is supportive yet

                                                    - We love that Puffy donates to multiple

                                                    Like most of the best bed-in-a-box brands, Puffy

                                                    mattresses (though we don't think you'll need
                                                    it!). If it's not a fit, you can return it for
                                                    free and get a full refund. Additionally, a
                                                    generous lifetime warranty builds a lot of trust
                                                    between sleepers and Puffy. If there are any
                                                    manufacturing or workmanship defects, Puffy will
                                                    repair or replace the mattress for free.

                                                    will need a few hours for decompressing and
                                                    off-gassing but you won't need to air it out
                                                    before sleeping on it.

                                                    hours for the mattress to fully expand and

                                        work with but I never was able to find a number that didn't

                                                    style of sleeper. We've tested the Lux in

                                        Sleep Number customer service people. They were very nice to
                                        work with but I never was able to find a number that didn't
                                        give me a backache. I concluded that I need a firm

                                                    style of sleeper. We've tested the Lux in

                                                    of comfort. In addition to comfort, sleepers

                                        the best setting. We have a regular king mattress no split
                                        and feels like we both move to the middle over the night.
                                        Our previous mattress, we never felt like we were sinking to

                                                    ‘Very Good' support for nearly every size and
                                                    style of sleeper. We've tested the Lux in
                                                    different sleep positions to determine the level
                                                    of comfort. In addition to comfort, sleepers
                                                    experience less back pain and feel relief with
                                                    Puffy's body-adaptive Plush Dual Cloud Foam. We
                                                    found the mattress to be extremely comfortable
                                                    and provided great full-body support for side
                                                    sleepers and back sleepers.

                                                    Recommended by Consumer Reports, the versatile
                                                    construction of the Puffy Lux comes through with
                                                    ‘Very Good' support for nearly every size and
                                                    style of sleeper. We've tested the Lux in
                                                    different sleep positions to determine the level
                                                    of comfort. In addition to comfort, sleepers
                                                    experience less back pain and feel relief with
                                                    Puffy's body-adaptive Plush Dual Cloud Foam. We
                                                    found the mattress to be extremely comfortable
                                                    and provided great full-body support for side
                                                    sleepers and back sleepers.

                                                    found the mattress to be extremely comfortable
                                                    and provided great full-body support for side

                                                    style of sleeper. We've tested the Lux in
                                                    different sleep positions to determine the level
                                                    of comfort. In addition to comfort, sleepers
                                                    experience less back pain and feel relief with

                                                    and provided great full-body support for side

                                                    While a hybrid mattress isn't a new concept,

                                                    other. The Puffy Lux is made of 6 layers, from a

                                                    it!). If it's not a fit, you can return it for

                                                    it!). If it's not a fit, you can return it for

                                                    style of sleeper. We've tested the Lux in

                                                    wick away moisture and prevent night sweats. We

                                                    - We love that Puffy donates to multiple
                                                    children's shelters and view it as an important

                                                    it!). If it's not a fit, you can return it for
                                                    free and get a full refund. Additionally, a

                                    While memory foam mattresses offer classic all-foam comfort,
                                    hybrid mattresses take the benefits of a memory foam mattress to
                                    the next level. Hybrid mattresses contain multiple memory foam
                                    layers with a spring base. This provides added support so
                                    sleepers won’t sink in and the mattress won’t sag. As a result,
                                    hybrid mattresses have a longer lifespan than memory foam
                                    mattresses, thanks to the extra-sturdy layer of springs.
                                    Additionally, hybrid mattresses disperse body heat away from the
                                    mattress, allowing for extra air circulation so you won't sweat
                                    or overheat while sleeping.

                                    responsiveness, the Puffy Lux Hybrid is a first-rate option.
                                    This mattress consists of a body-adaptive coils base and a
                                    cooling gel-infused layer for optimized airflow, which allows
                                    for breathable and cool sleep. With multiple memory foam layers,
                                    including Plush Dual Cloud Foam, the Puffy Lux Hybrid minimizes
                                    strain from the shoulders, hips, and lower back area, and offers
                                    total comfort for sleepers.

                                    When a product is expensive, having a generous warranty will
                                    give you peace of mind when making your purchase. The warranty
                                    protects the product against defects in craftsmanship or any
                                    physical flaws, so you can either exchange the product or get
                                    the issue fixed during the warranty period. Buying a mattress
                                    with a lifetime warranty is the safest option because the
                                    mattress will be protected for as long as you’re sleeping on it.
                                    Additionally, a lot of brands offer lengthy trial periods so you
                                    can test your mattress before committing to it.
